            Julio Cortázar, pseudonym Julio Denis   (born August 26, 1914, Brussels, Belgium—died February 12, 1984, Paris, France), Argentine novelist and short-story writer who combined existential questioning with experimental writing techniques in his works.

            Cortázar was the son of Argentine parents and was educated in Argentina, where he taught secondary school and worked as a translator. Bestiario (1951; “Bestiary”), his first short-story collection, was published the year he moved to Paris, an act motivated by dissatisfaction with the government of Juan Perón and what he saw as the general stagnation of the Argentine middle class. He remained in Paris, where he received French citizenship in 1981, though he also kept his Argentine citizenship and remained engaged with political causes in Argentina and Nicaragua. He also traveled widely.

                As one of the main characters, the intellectual Juan, puts it: to one person the City might appear as Paris, to another it might be where one goes upon getting out of bed in Barcelona; to another it might appear as a beer hall in Oslo. This cityscape, as Carlos Fuentes describes it, "seems drawn up by the Marx Brothers with an assist from Bela Lugosi!" It is the meeting place for a wild assortment of bohemians in a novel described by The New York Times as "Deeply touching, enjoyable, beautifully written and fascinatingly mysterious." Library Journal has said 62: A Model Kit is "a highly satisfying work by one of the most extraordinary writers of our time."

                Cortázar's only explicitly political novel, it was written as a direct response to the escalating political repression and violence in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America. Though it received the Medici Award, it received a generally lukewarm critical reception and was described by the author himself as "the worst of my books." Describing the unfolding of a plot to kidnap a Latin American diplomat, it incorporates into the text a number of news articles reproduced from contemporary newspaper accounts of the political situation in Latin America. Cortázar directed that all the royalties from the book be used to provide assistance to the victims of political repression.
