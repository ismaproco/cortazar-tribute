#Tribute to Julio Cortazar

I create this page as part of the first challenge in the FreeCodeCamp page, Tribute page.

Why Julio Cortazar?
-------------------

For me he is one of the gratest writers of Latin America, who shown a part of our continent that struggles to identify himself even today. His short stories and novels always play in between the fantastic and reality, and is easy to identify myself with many of the stories.
